# Reflection
Through the presentations given by Habib and PPG, I gained a better grasp of how to advance my professional development going forward. Undoubtedly, a person must possess a wide range of abilities to work as a data engineer, including survival skills and computer language proficiency. A strong CV will also help us get noticed by the firm of our choice because it will highlight all of the honours and positions we have earned while in school.
