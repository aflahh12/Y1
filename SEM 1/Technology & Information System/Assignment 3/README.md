# Reflection
My understanding of my future as a computer science student has improved as a result of the industrial visit to Petronas and Huawei. 
To achieve in life, it does in fact inspire me to sharpen my abilities and work harder in my studies. In addition, growing my network 
is going to be crucial going forward because it will be very beneficial to the sector.
